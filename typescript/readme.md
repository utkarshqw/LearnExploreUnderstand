make js and ts try of make sense 
- All the code we write will finally be compield into js 

- In js 2 + "2" will give "22" with ts no 
why?
In Js when arithmetic ops. involve null, it undergoes a type conversion to a number and it becomes 0.
This happens because JavaScript performs type coercion. 

- In js undefined + 2 with give NaN
why?
When a variable is undefined it is declared by not defined so js converts it to NaN and arithmetic ops. involving NaN results in NaN

- At ts does is static checking , it's a development tool our code still runs in js

- In typescript something are allowed and something are not we have to know that 

- sudo means "superuser do"

- some of the types of typescript are 
  Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefiend, Void, Object, Array, Tuples, Any, Unknown

- Typescript situations
  A function accepts 2 numbers 
  A function returns a string 

- Syntax
  let variableName: type = vlaue
  all types are in lowercase 

- Primitives string, number and boolean 
- for float and int we just use the type number
- any type means don't do the type checking 

- Do you really know function 7
  in the case of funtion types are very necessary 
  if one argument is left ts will show error 
  default value can be alloted if wanted to avoid the above 

- A better way to write function 8   
  Func should have defined return 
  syntax after () define :type of return value 
  more than one type can be used by using union type
  When user map try of provide return type
  stntax array.map((elem):type=>{return value})
  never function ends program or throws exception 
  void function that returns nothing
